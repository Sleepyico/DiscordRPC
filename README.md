## Initialization 5.3

Version 5.3 has changed a little bit. it now has ```DiscordGameInstance``` class which handles most of the logic for you; streamlining the process, making it much faster to get up and running.

1) A. You need to inherit your ```GameInstance``` class from ```DiscordGameInstance```:

1) B. If you're using unreals default ```GameInstance``` You'll need to create your own and inherit it from ```DiscordGameInstance``` then set your project to use that class in your project settings:

I called my instance ```I_GameInstance``` (but just set it to whatever yours is called):

2) Now that we are inheriting from ```DiscordGameInstance```, we can set out App IDs. Simpily override event ```init``` and call ```SetAppIDs``` while passing your IDs into the params:
> **Note :** AppID IS REQUIRED, Steam is OPTIONAL

## Set Basic/All Presence

There are two ways of setting presence, ```SetBasicPresence``` and ```SetAllPresence```; Basic sets just the need to know features, lick icon, state, details and time elasped. Whereas - All sets all values that are in the ```DiscordPresence``` struct.
So anytime you need to update the presence info call any of these nodes:

## Set Discord Presence

Finally, once we have set our basic/all presence we can send it to the discord API using ```SetDiscordPresence```:

```SetDiscordPresence``` also has a clear function build into it to clear the presence during runtime if you need to switch it when you switch maps/activities:

## Deprecated

### Shutdown:

You'll no longer have to override event ```Shutdown``` as this is already done in code for you:

### Start and End Timpstamps:

You no longer have to manually set timestamps, this gets handled for you in the ```DiscordGameInstance``` class

There was also a issue with mismatched types for timestamps which caused the plugin to not work in packaged builds which has now been fixed also.
