## Deprecated

### Shutdown:

You'll no longer have to override event ```Shutdown``` as this is already done in code for you:  

```cpp
void UDiscordGameInstance::Shutdown()
{
  Super::Shutdown();

  if (!DiscordRpc)
      return;

  SetDiscordPresence(EDiscordPresenceState::Clear);
}
```

### Start and End Timpstamps:

You no longer have to manually set timestamps, this gets handled for you in the ```DiscordGameInstance``` class

```cpp
StampRef = DiscordRpc->GetStartTimeStamp();
```
```cpp
UFUNCTION(BlueprintPure)
    int64 GetStartTimeStamp() const {return FDateTime::Now().ToUnixTimestamp(;)}
```

There was also a issue with mismatched types for timestamps which caused the plugin to not work in packaged builds which has now been fixed also.
